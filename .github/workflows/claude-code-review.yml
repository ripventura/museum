            Review style instructions:
            - Be concise and direct. No filler, no pleasantries, no praise.
            - Only comment on things that actually need to change: bugs, logic errors, security issues, performance problems, or violations of the project's architecture and conventions defined in CLAUDE.md.
            - Do NOT comment on minor style preferences, naming opinions, or things that are "fine but could be slightly different".
            - If there are no meaningful issues, say so in one sentence and move on.
            - Each comment should state the problem and why it matters in 1-2 sentences max.
